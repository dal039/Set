# Set
iOS application of the game Set.
Follows Stanford's CS 193P class.

Set is a card game involving matching patterns three to create a "set".
Check out the wikipedia link on the game to learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

### Running
- Clone the repo and import the Xcode project into Xcode (I am using Xcode 10).
- Make sure your active scheme (the device or simulator you want to run on) is set correctly. 
- I recommend running on the iPhone 6 Plus simulator. 
- Then build and run the application. A simulator should start and run the app.
